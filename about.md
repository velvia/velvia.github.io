I like to think of myself as an artist.  Whether behind the [camera lens](https://www.instagram.com/platypus.arts/), or leading dance moves on the floor, or creating next-generation distributed systems, aesthetics and purpose are important to me, as well as community.

### Open Source Projects

These are all projects I created or co-created, and I maintain most of them... when time allows :)

* [Spark Job Server](http://github.com/spark-jobserver/spark-jobserver) - REST API for Apache Spark job submission, logging, control
    * Job Server is being included in Datastax Enterprise!
* [FiloDB](http://github.com/filodb/FiloDB) and [filo](http://github.com/velvia/filo) - high performance distributed analytical database built on Apache Spark and Cassandra
* [Scala links](http://github.com/velvia/links) - useful links for learning Scala and Scala projects
* [ScalaStorm](http://github.com/velvia/ScalaStorm)
* [msgpack4s](http://github.com/velvia/msgpack4s) - a fast, streaming-friendly, type-safe MessagePack library for Scala
