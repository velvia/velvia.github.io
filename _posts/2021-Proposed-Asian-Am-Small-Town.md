- Why were our white friends so much more enthusiastic about our move to a small rural town in the mountains?
- The Asian American hate
- model minority myth
- as soon as we stand up for justice and critize the system....
- the flag protest gulf and what it revealed
- the long, whitewashed history of AsianAm hate (and how Truckee still doesn't acknowledge the past)
- why fighting against the white majority is SO exhausting
- It's not just racism - how exceptionalism and refusal to face facts and turn things around hurts America on every issue - gun violence, health care, climate change, etc. etc.
    + White liberal America just has no idea how broken the system is.  BIPOC knew.  Trump has been a wake up call.  Many of us privileged Asian Ams "model minority" have bought into the exceptionalism too!
    + Partly based on feeling like the greatest country on earth for so long - yet exceptionalism is rooted in false pride.  How much of America's wealth was built on top of slaves and abusing native people and conquering their land?
- "White Supremacists are killing our Asian brothers and sisters, because they killed our indigenous brothers and sisters and were not FULLY held accountable; they killed Black folks and have not been held accountable."
- The importance of humility and togetherness
